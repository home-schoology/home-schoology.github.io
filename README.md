## Meanings of files

The method it follows is GSV (Game Server Version);

Lets use "1v1-s1v1.html" as an example; "1v1" is the game (1v1.lol), "s1" is the server (server 1), and "v1" is the version.

### Games
Games are just the game name (may be edited to be smaller).


### Servers
Servers represent the source of the game, so server 1 could be a link (lets say its "example.com"), if I were to add another server it would have to be different from server 1 (cant be "example.com", can be "other-example.com"). Each game has their own server list, so one game's server 1 isnt another game's server 1 ("example.com" is server 1 for 'fungame', but "placeholder.com" is server 1 for 'fungame2'.


### Versions
Versions are the method the games are displayed/activated, these are the same for every game (version 1 is version 1 for every game, and version 2 is version 2 for every game). 

If a version's value is not there, and in its place is the word "flat", it means the game is not from an external source (file is self hosted).
