# Flash Games

Forked from [LQ16's repo](https://github.com/LQ16/gstore). More cleanerer, no duplicates.

The html5games directory has been removed, as it has been unused for a long time. If your games stop working, please update your [gfiles](https://github.com/BinBashBanana/gfiles).

The rarch directory will continue *for now*, but it is now unused and will be removed in the future.
